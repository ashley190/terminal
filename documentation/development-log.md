| Jul 10 | Idea approved by Senior Developer. Began work on Software development plan and implementation plan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Jul 11 | Began resource gathering process for features 2 and 3.  Wine selection process chart finalised.  Software development plan and implementation plan updated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Jul 12 | Coding begins. Completed coding of the first versions of Features 1 and 2.  Bug fixes was completed concurrently as coding was underway.  A very productive day, all known bugs for features 1 and 2 resolved and began coding Feature 3 by the end of the day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Jul 13 | Resource gathering completed for wine description library. The select function was written to automate printing of each selection step in Feature 2. Additional DRY-ing up of code - I managed to DRY up my code from 100 lines down to 35 in Feature 2 using functions. Realised that an age checking function might be a good idea as a gatekeeper to the application (Feature 4).                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Jul 14 | Worked heavily again on Feature to to incorporate Feature 5 (go backwards) option.  Reworked feature 2 from using if statements to a while loop.  Bug fixing as the code was written.  It was very difficult to fix the Feature 5 bug where the application exits and an error was thrown when user navigates beyond first selection step. Explored the curses module to perhaps incorporate into feature 2 to enable an interactive menu for the selection process,  found it too complex and decided there wasn't enough time to implement without compromising testing. Perhaps implement in version 2. |
| Jul 15 | DRY-ed up library by combining two separate libraries (purpose and wine_list) into a single library.  Reworked code for Features 2 and 3 to recalibrate the reference points.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Jul 16 | Implemented prettytables module to display selection results in a tabular format. Cosmetic changes were implemented on the text to insert line breaks to make text more readable.  Implemented Feature 6 enabling wines to be selected for more than one purpose. Began testing phase. Found 6 bugs through testing that required fixing. Started working on README.md.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Jul 17 | Fixed all bugs from testing phase.  Further cosmetic changes using Term Color to highlight text to improve readability. Converted main.py into an executable file with --about and --help arguments.  Complete writing up software development plan and implementation plan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
