Jul 10 -    Idea approved by Senior Dev. Start drafting software development plan.

            Found a way to incorporate the select function into the control flow for Feature 2!
            Realised that I forgot to check for legal age. Added this new feature at the beginning that causes program to exit if user below legal drinking age.
            Worked on keeping code DRY - shortened feature two control flow in main.py from 100 lines to 35 lines! Pretty proud!
Jul 14 -    Worked on options to navigate backwards in feature 2. Rewrote control flow into while loop and moved into a function. Works!
            Tried implementing curses for select options for feature 2; too complex - put into future versions?
