            Found a way to incorporate the select function into the control flow for Feature 2!
            Realised that I forgot to check for legal age. Added this new feature at the beginning that causes program to exit if user below legal drinking age.
            Worked on keeping code DRY - shortened feature two control flow in main.py from 100 lines to 35 lines! Pretty proud!
