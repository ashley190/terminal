Jul 10 -    Idea approved by Senior Dev. Start drafting software development plan.
Jul 11 -    Drafted out wine selection process chart. Refined software development and implementation plan. 
Jul 12 -    Completed coding features 1 and 2. Started coding on feature 3. Bug fixes in features 1 and 2.
Jul 13 -    Completed wine description library. 
            Found a way to incorporate the select function into the control flow for Feature 2!
            Realised that I forgot to check for legal age. Added this new feature at the beginning that causes program to exit if user below legal drinking age.
            Worked on keeping code DRY - shortened feature two control flow in main.py from 100 lines to 35 lines! Pretty proud!
Jul 14 -    Worked on options to navigate backwards in feature 2. Rewrote control flow into while loop and moved into a function. Works!
            Tried implementing curses for select options for feature 2; will pass assignment due by the time I figure this out - perhaps in version 2?
Jul 15 -    Combined purpose and wine list in winelibrary.py
