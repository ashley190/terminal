Jul 12 -    Completed coding features 1 and 2. Started coding on feature 3. Bug fixes in features 1 and 2.

            Found a way to incorporate the select function into the control flow for Feature 2!
            Realised that I forgot to check for legal age. Added this new feature at the beginning that causes program to exit if user below legal drinking age.
            Worked on keeping code DRY - shortened feature two control flow in main.py from 100 lines to 35 lines! Pretty proud!
Jul 14 -    Worked on options to navigate backwards in feature 2. Rewrote control flow into while loop and moved into a function. Works!
            Tried implementing curses for select options for feature 2; will pass assignment due by the time I figure this out - perhaps in version 2?
Jul 15 -    Combined purpose and wine list in winelibrary.py
Jul 16 -    Worked on improving the presentation of the text to a better layout in Feature 2 and Feature 3. Implemented table to display Feature 3.
