# Wine Assistant Terminal Application

## Objective 
The objective of the Wine Assistant is to provide wine suggestions for different purposes as selected by a user loosely based on the flow chart adopted from [Wine Folly](https://media.winefolly.com/how-to-choose-wine-infographic.png#fullsize).

## Target Audience
The intended target audience of this application is for people who:-
* enjoys the occasional bottle/glass of wine
* does not have much knowledge about wines but wants to have something suitable certain occasions
* may or may not have access to a personal sommelier
* need help selecting wine for different preferences or circumstances

## Application Features
1. Age checker - Application will check for user age at the start of the application. If below legal age, app will exit with no option to continue. 
2. Invalid entry checks - where user input needs to be a specific range of values, user entry will be checked for invalid entries and users prompted for input until a valid input is entered.
3. User will be guided through the selection process as laid out in the ![Wine selection control flow](<<link>>). Users can also navigate backwards during the selection process if a selection error is made.
4. Results of the selection will be displayed at the conclusion of the selection process. Results can be a one-liner or a table listing the type(s) of suitable wine, description of each type of wine, suitable food pairing option(s) and suitable alternatives(if available).
5. Users have the option to repeat the selection process for as many purposes as required at the end of each selection process. If more than one selection was made, a summary will be printed before the application exits.
